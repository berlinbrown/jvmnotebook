The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)—with Sun's implementation known as HotSpot—is a versatile Java bytecode interpreter celebrated for its speed, portability, and robust security. Beyond Java, the JVM powers various language implementations such as Jython (Python), JRuby (Ruby), Scala, and ABCL (Common Lisp), each leveraging the JVM's capabilities while adding their unique "sugar" to enhance developer experience.

The JVM Notebook serves as a comprehensive review of JVM languages, exploring their features and interplay with the JVM ecosystem.

Note: This project is deprecated and has not been updated since 2011. Nevertheless, it may still provide valuable insights or resources for those interested in JVM-based languages and their development.
