------------------------------------
Jython programs can seamlessly import and use any Java class. 
Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules. 
Jython includes almost all of the modules in the standard Python programming language distribution, 
lacking only some of the modules implemented originally in C. 
For example, a user interface in Jython would be written with Swing, AWT or SWT. 
Jython compiles to Java bytecode (intermediate language) either on demand or statically.
