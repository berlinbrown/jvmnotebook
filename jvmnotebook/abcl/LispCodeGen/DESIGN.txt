Misc Notes:

 - We will need to make the page creation by working from top to bottom
 	as opposed to function driven.

*Code Generation*

	+PHP Aspect:
		
		The focus of the PHP component centers around
		CRUD operations(Create Read Update and Delete).
		A set of libraries are devoted to create server-side pages 
		for 'create' and insert operations; modules are devoted to 
		'read' operation, etc.
						
*Deploy*

	The deploy component is based on the j-ftp java library.
	This library provides support for transferring files via
	FTP and SFTP.
