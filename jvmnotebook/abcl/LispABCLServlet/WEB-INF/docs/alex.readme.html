<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>You need some Java servlet container to run this servlet, for example, Apache Jakarta Tomcat.
When servlet container is working, this web application should be copied in webapps directory, just
like any other (possibly some configuration of servlet container is also required to launch it). 
When it's ready, it's headpage should be accessible at http://localhost:8080/demosvlet/LspExec.
</p>
<p>ABCL itself is not included in this package. You should either build it youself, or 
take pre-built one. When you have abcl.jar (or whatever), just copy it to demosvlet/WEB-INF/lib directory.
</p>
<p>Debugging support requires some emacs or xemacs and recent version of SLIME (SLIME version
should support current ABCL, version in CVS at 06.06.05 supports ABCL 0.0.5). Check first that
installation of SLIME works with ABCL. Then point path to swank-loader.lisp in WEB-INF/lisp/dbgrstart.lisp
to the directory you've installed SLIME in. Then try to start debugger servlet at
http://localhost:8080/demosvlet/LspDebug. When it shows it's form (where you can enter some
lisp forms to be evaluated -- this is most primitive 'debugger'), you can load your emacs
and issue slime-connect command. At this point SLIME should connect to the ABCL running in servlet, 
so top-level prompt will appear where you can enter commands and debug servlets.<br/>
If you need debugging, first launch LspDebug, then connect to it, and only then launch LspExec.
You will see messages of loading servlet in repl window, and if something goes wrong with 
loading servlet, you can fix them and use restarts in debugger.
</p>
<p>If you uncomment &lt;load-on-startup&gt; tag in WEB-INF/web.xml, you can automatically launch
either debug
</p>
<p>I've tested this in two different configurations: Windows XP Prof with Tomcat 5 and
Solaris 10 x86 with Tomcat 4. Under WinXP it works as is, under Solaris i had some problems
with ABCL compiler -- Java is unable to create temporary file.
In this case substitute line in Extensions.java 
<pre>
File file = File.createTempFile("abcl", null, null);
</pre>
with 
<pre>
File file = File.createTempFile("abcl", null, new File("/tmp/"));
</pre>
(it is in the end of file in implementation of function make-temp-file).
I have no clue if this problem exists in other installations and under other
unix-like systems like Linux.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>Bridge between Java servlets and Lisp is done in two Java classes implementing servlets -- LspExec
and LspDebug. LspExec initializes Lisp interpreter, loads startup file (servlet-loader.lisp)
and then looks for variable cl-user::*servlet*. If it exists, its content is treated like an object
implementing javax.servlet.Servlet interface. When requests arrive, LspExec just forwards calls to
this object's functions.<br/>
LspDebug is a some debugging interface. It displays form that allows to execute forms like in REPL.
Also, it loads SLIME and launches it's server. When SLIME is loaded, LspExec uses it's debugger
hooks so it's possible to debug servlets in emacs.
</p>
<p>From Lisp side, structure is quite complex too.<br/>
LspExec loads servlet-loader.lisp at startup. It loads required libraries (asdf, jfli-abcl and 
lml2) and tries loading servlet.lisp. It installs abort and retry restarts, so if there
are some problems loading servlet (for example, one of files are incompilable), it's possible to
fix problem and retry. servlet.lisp creates SERVLET1 package, imports required Java classes
and loads files of servlet framework.

<h3>Framework</h3>
<p>Historically, at first servlet was used in simple model-view-controller style of work.
So, there were just three functions: analyze-request, process-request and generate-output.
Then continuations were used on top of this layer -- process-request function was not used anymore,
analyze-request decoded continuation and form parameters and generate-output called that continuation.
<p>servlet.lisp defines general entry functions --  analyze-request, process-request and generate-output,
that are provided by application itself. This functions are called in required order on Servlet.service function.
servlet.lisp also loads code of CPS-transform (code by Marco Baringer) and application code.
</p>
<p>app.lisp implements analyze-page and generate-output functions. analyze-page grabs 
form parameters in plist and finds out continuation id. generate-output function then
checks whether continuation exists. if it does, it is called with plist of form parameters, 
that are prepended with 'verb' -- special parameter that identifies form. If continuation is 
not present, it calls entry function (go-front-page) (from app-logic.lisp).
</p>app-logic.lisp implements application logic. functions there are defines with defun/cc, that
means that they are specially instrumented to be used with continuations.
When some form should be displayed, they call page-generator functions from app-pages.lisp.
That page-generators (called gen-xxx-page typically) store current continuation in continuations
table and generate form output, then they exit -- entirely from application logic section.
When user provides input to form, continuation is called so plist of form parameters become 
the return of gen-xxx-page function. There are three useful macros to destructure such list in app-logic.lisp.
<ul><li>First is vcase. It simply selects statements based on form verb ('verb' is used for
form identification, it's name specified in hidden input field). For example,
<pre>
(vcase (gen-user-menu-page username)
			 (:add-numbers (numbers-op '+))
			 (:mul-numbers (numbers-op '*))
			 (:exit (return))
</pre>
</li>
<li>vbind ignores verb, but it binds form parameters to variable. It distinguished string
variables from integers. For example
<pre>
(vbind (gen-student-list-page)
	((int student-id) password)
	(list student-id password))
</pre>
</li>
<li>vcase-bind is a combination of vcase and vbind. Depending on verb parameter, it 
destructures different parameters:
<pre>
(vcase-bind  (gen-student-main-menu-page student)
	 (:view-lecture ((int lecture-id))
			(show-lecture lecture-id))
	 (:start-test ((int test-id))
		      (show-student-test student test-id))
	 (:start-practice () (practical-task student section))
</pre>
</ul>
</p>
<p>app-pages.lisp contains function that generate html pages with help of lml2.
make-page macro automatically generates page prologue and stores continuation in table.
Special variable *cc-id* contain identifier of current continuation. It is automatically
appended to all forms that are created with verb-form macro. Special variable value is
somehow lost in functions that are not defines with defun/cc, so it's explicitly passed there.</p>
<p>cont.lisp is just an implementation of storage for continuation closures</p>
