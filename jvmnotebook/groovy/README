-----------------------------

Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java Platform 
as an alternative to the Java programming language. It is a dynamic language 
with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk. 
It can be used as a scripting language for the Java Platform.

Groovy uses a Java-like curly bracket syntax which is dynamically compiled 
to Java Virtual Machine bytecodes and which works seamlessly with other 
Java code and libraries. The Groovy compiler can be used to generate standard 
Java bytecode to be used by any Java project. Most Java code is valid Groovy syntax 
and can be used dynamically as a scripting language.
