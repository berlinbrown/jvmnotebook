 * This is the main class of the Mona Lisa Painting Problem. It starts the
 * application. Please notice that this is the Genetic Algorithms version.
 * Another implementation of the problem is done with Genetic Programming.
 * Please see package examples.gp.monalisa.
 *
 * The Mona Lisa Painting Problem is to find a number of polygons that form
 * a picture which corresponds as good as possible to a given input picture.
 * Originally, the Mona Lisa from Leonardo da Vinci was chosen as input.<p>
 * See http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/
