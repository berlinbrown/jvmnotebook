\section{Spring MVC Framework}

Spring is one of the latest Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) replacement 
frameworks that is supposed to provide minimal presentation layer support, 
business logic support as well as the backend, persistance support. 
It is basically a framework to bind all frameworks. And, on top 
of everything I just mentioned, it is lightweight. 
From working with it, it is a lot easier to work with than with the early EJBs.

It was created by Rod Johnson, orignally in the year 2000, but recently released over the last few years.
It is a Java framework that is growing rapidly. Recently, BEA have been in talks with
Interface21 (Spring's Host company) for a possible partnership. The key is light but flexible. What does
that mean exactly? Spring is modular, all the Spring libraries are broken up so that you can work with
separate parts of your application individually as opposed to tackling everything at once.
