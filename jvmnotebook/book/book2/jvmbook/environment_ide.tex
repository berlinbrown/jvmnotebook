Spring is one of the latest Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) replacement 
frameworks that is supposed to provide minimal presentation layer support, 
business logic support as well as the backend, persistance support. 
It is basically a framework to bind all frameworks. And, on top 
of everything I just mentioned, it is lightweight. 
From working with it, it is a lot easier to work with than with the early EJBs.
