 ---------------------------------
 Jscheme is my implementation of Scheme in Java. This page presents Jscheme version 1.4, 
 the last version that I released (in April 1998). If you want a mercilessly small, 
 easily modifiable version, this is it. Since April 1998, development has been picked up by others, 
 notably Tim Hickey at Brandeis and Ken Anderson at BBN.
