 -------------------------------- 
 In computer based language recognition, ANother Tool for Language Recognition (ANTLR) 
 is the name of a parser generator that uses LL(*) parsing. ANTLR is the successor 
 to the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set (PCCTS), first developed in 1989, 
 and is under active development. 
 Its maintainer is professor Terence Parr of the University of San Francisco.

 ANTLR rules are expressed in a format deliberately similar to EBNF instead of the 
 regular expression syntax employed by other parser generators.
