---------------------------------------

The Java Virtual Machine ( Sun's JVM is called HotSpot ) is a java bytecode interpreter 
which is fast, portable and secure. Jython, JRuby, Scala, ABCL (Common Lisp) 
are popular language implementations that run on the JVM that allow for the 
jvmcookbook sugar of their particular languages.

---------------------------------------

This project contains multiple sub-projects and code demos related to those jvm language implementations.
